- ðŸ“• I follow a specific naming convention for my repositories. For repositories that can be cloned and used as a template, I use the format 'template-'. For repositories containing problems or challenges I have solved, I use 'labs-'. Finally, for repositories where I explain how to do something, I use 'tutorials-'.
